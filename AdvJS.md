JavaScript is often described as a synchronous and single-threaded programming language.

## Execution context, Call Stack, Memory Heap

In JavaScript, the concepts of "execution context," "call stack," and "memory heap" are fundamental to understanding how the language works.

### 1. Execution Context:
- An execution context is an abstract concept representing the environment in which JavaScript code is executed. It includes information about the code being executed, variables, scope, and more.
- There are three types of execution contexts in JavaScript:
  - **Global Execution Context:** The default or outermost execution context. It represents the entire script and is created when the script is executed.
  - **Function Execution Context:** Created when a function is called. Each function call has its own execution context.
  - **Eval Execution Context:** Created when code is executed inside an `eval` function.

### 2. Call Stack:
- The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the execution context of a program. It follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, where the last function called is the first one to be resolved.
- When a function is called, its execution context is pushed onto the call stack. When the function completes, its context is popped off the stack.
- The call stack helps in managing the flow of execution in a synchronous, single-threaded environment.

### 3. Memory Heap:
- The memory heap is a region in a computer's memory where variables and objects are stored.
- It is a large, unstructured region of memory, and the JavaScript runtime allocates memory for variables and objects dynamically during the program's execution.
- Objects in the heap can reference each other, creating complex data structures.

### Example:
```javascript
function greet(name) {
  let message = `Hello, ${name}!`;
  console.log(message);
}

function main() {
  console.log('Start');
  greet('Alice');
  greet('Bob');
  console.log('End');
}

main();
```

**Execution Flow:**
1. The global execution context is created when the script starts (`main` function call).
2. `main` function is called, and its execution context is pushed onto the call stack.
3. `console.log('Start')` is executed, and then the `greet('Alice')` function is called.
4. The `greet` function is pushed onto the call stack, and its execution context is created.
5. Inside `greet`, `let message = ...` is executed, and `console.log(message)` is called.
6. After `greet('Alice')` completes, its execution context is popped off the stack.
7. The same steps happen for `greet('Bob')`.
8. Finally, `console.log('End')` is executed in the `main` function, and the global execution context is completed.

Understanding these concepts is crucial for debugging, optimizing code, and grasping the fundamentals of how JavaScript manages the execution of your programs.


## Synchronous,  Single threaded

### Synchronous:
- In a synchronous programming language, code is executed sequentially, one statement at a time.
- Each statement must complete before the next one starts.
- Synchronous code is straightforward and easier to understand but can lead to blocking behavior, where certain operations take a significant amount of time and halt the execution of the entire program.

### Single-Threaded:
- Single-threaded means that JavaScript has only one thread of execution, which means it can only do one thing at a time.
- Unlike multi-threaded environments, where multiple tasks can be executed simultaneously, JavaScript has a single call stack, and it processes one operation at a time.
- This is closely tied to the event-driven nature of JavaScript, especially in the context of web development, where it is often used in browsers.

However, JavaScript also has features that enable asynchronous behavior:

1. **Event Loop:**
   - The event loop is a crucial component of JavaScript's asynchronous nature.
   - While JavaScript is executing synchronous code, it also manages an event queue and processes events in a non-blocking way.
   - Asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API or responding to user input, are typically handled through callbacks and the event loop.

2. **Callbacks and Promises:**
   - Callback functions are used to handle asynchronous operations. They are passed as arguments to functions that perform asynchronous tasks.
   - Promises were introduced to make asynchronous code more readable and maintainable. They provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations and avoid "callback hell."

```javascript
// Example of asynchronous code using a callback
function fetchData(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Data fetched');
    callback();
  }, 1000);
}

console.log('Start');
fetchData(() => {
  console.log('End');
});
```

In this example, even though the `setTimeout` function simulates an asynchronous operation, the code is executed in a single thread, and the callback is invoked after the timeout.

In summary, while JavaScript is primarily synchronous and single-threaded, its event-driven nature, along with features like callbacks and promises, enables effective handling of asynchronous operations. This is particularly important in environments like web browsers, where responsiveness and non-blocking behavior are essential for a smooth user experience.


## Async Await

Certainly! In JavaScript, `async` and `await` are features that make working with asynchronous code more readable and easier to manage.

### `async` Function:
- When a function is declared with the `async` keyword, it means that the function will always return a promise, and the execution of the function is automatically wrapped in a promise.
- Inside an `async` function, you can use the `await` keyword to pause the execution of the function until a promise is resolved or rejected.
- The `async` keyword is often used in front of a function declaration to create asynchronous functions.

Example:
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  // Asynchronous operation, e.g., fetching data
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
}
```

### `await` Keyword:
- The `await` keyword is used inside an `async` function to wait for a promise to resolve before continuing with the execution of the function.
- It can only be used inside an `async` function.
- It makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code, making it easier to read and maintain.

Example:
```javascript
async function example() {
  console.log('Start');
  const result = await someAsyncFunction();
  console.log(result);
  console.log('End');
}
```

In this example, the function `example` logs "Start," then waits for the promise returned by `someAsyncFunction` to resolve before logging the result and finally logging "End."

Using `async` and `await` is particularly beneficial when dealing with asynchronous operations such as fetching data from APIs, reading files, making database queries, etc. These features simplify the syntax and structure of asynchronous code, making it more intuitive and easier to reason about.


## Blocking code vs Non-blocking code

Blocing code: Block the flow of program (sync)

Non-blocking code: Does not block execution (async)
